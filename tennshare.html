											<p>In 2008, a friend of mine and I were approached to redesign the Tenn-Share website. I have served as Co-Webmistress and Co-Chair of the Web Committee ever since.</p>

											<h3>Service</h3>
											<h4>Co-Webmistress and Co-Chair of the Web Committee, 2008 &#8211; present</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>attend board meetings</li>
												<li>troubleshoot technical problems</li>
												<li>build new features into the site as they are requested</li>
												<li>keep our Drupal installation up to date</li>
												<li>help update content as needed</li>
											</ul>

											<h4>Archives Committee, 2009 &#8211; present</h4>
											<p>I volunteered for this committee to help organize our digital archival material.  With the recent retirement of Tenn-Share&#8217;s longtime executive director, this task will become more important in the months to come.</p>

											<h4>Learn and Discover Lesson Expert, 2009 and 2010</h4>
											<p><strong></strong>Learn and Discover is a summer learning program based on the 23 Things learning program. Each week featured a different topic and an &#8220;expert&#8221; on that topic to help craft the lesson and interact with participants in that week&#8217;s forum discussion.  I participated in several lessons in 2009 and 2010:</p>
