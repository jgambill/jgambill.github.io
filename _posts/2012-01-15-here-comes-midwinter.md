I can’t believe I’m leaving for Midwinter this week!  This will be my first ALA conference, so I’m not completely sure what to expect.  I do know my schedule is overflowing with what looks to be some awesome sessions and social gatherings.

I get to go to Midwinter because I’m a 2012 [ALA Emerging Leader][ala-el-home]. I’m so excited and honored to be chosen to participate in this leadership program. I am working on Project K, in which our team will scope out an experts profile system/database for LITA. LITA is sponsoring my participation in the Emerging Leaders program, and I’m very happy to be able to give back by helping them out with a needed tool.

I hope to do a post per day summarizing my thoughts on the sessions I attend. We’ll see how that goes. I want a good record of what I see and do – I know it will be a whirlwind of information and networking that will escape my brain if I don’t record it.

Next stop: Dallas!
