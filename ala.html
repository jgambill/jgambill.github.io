											<p>I joined the American Library Association (ALA) in 2005 while I was still in graduate school.  I didn't become more involved in the association until 2008, when I volunteered for some committee work with NMRT.  I always struggled with ALA involvement because of my historic lack of resources to attend ALA conferences.  I was able to find some committee assignments that did not require conference attendance, which was perfect.</p>
											<p>I am very honored to have been chosen as a 2012 ALA Emerging Leader!  I am confident this will be a great way for me to get more deeply involved in ALA, which is a benefit to both myself and the association.  I look forward to where this opportunity takes me.</p>
