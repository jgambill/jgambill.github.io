											<p>I obtained my <a href="http://www.sis.utk.edu/programs/masters">Master of Science degree in Information Science</a> from <a href="http://www.sis.utk.edu/">the School of Information Sciences (SIS) at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville (UTK)</a> in 2007.  I completed my degree via their distance education program, only stepping onto campus for orientation, for my comprehensive exam, and for graduation (optional). It was a great program in that I didn&#8217;t have to uproot my family or leave my library job to complete my degree. I truly do not feel like I missed out on anything by not being on campus &#8211; I learned a lot and made both professional contacts and great friends.</p>
