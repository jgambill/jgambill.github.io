<h3>Formal Education</h3>

<div class="group education-group">
    <div class="title">M.S. Information Science</div>
    <div class="school">University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Knoxville, TN</div>
    <div class="dates">2007</div>
    <p>I completed my degree via <a href="http://www.sis.utk.edu/programs/de">UTK-SIS's distance education program</a>, only stepping onto campus for orientation, for my comprehensive exam, and for graduation (optional). It was a great program in that I didn’t have to uproot my family or leave my library job to complete my degree. I truly do not feel like I missed out on anything by not being on campus – I learned a lot and made both professional contacts and great friends. After graduation, I served on the UTK SIS Alumni Board in 2009 – 2010, at which time the board was disbanded.</p>

<div class="group education-group">
    <div class="title">B.S. Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science</div>
    <div class="school">Lipscomb University, Nashville, TN</div>
    <div class="dates">2003</div>
    <p>I was very close to a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science -- I wish I had taken those two or three additional classes now! I learned many of the fundamental concepts of programming that I use today for web development in my undergraduate classes. I was also a student worker in the university library, which sparked my interest in a career in libraries.</p>
