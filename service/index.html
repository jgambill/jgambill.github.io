    <h3>ALA</h3>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>I joined the American Library Association (ALA) in 2005 while I was still in graduate school.  I didn’t become more involved in the association until 2008, when I volunteered for some committee work with NMRT.  I always struggled with ALA involvement because of my historic lack of resources to attend ALA conferences.  I was able to find some committee assignments that did not require conference attendance, which was perfect. I was very honored to have been chosen to participate in the ALA Emerging Leaders Program in 2012, sponsored by LITA. Since then, I have been able to be more involved in LITA and hope to continue this trend in the coming years.</p>

        <h4>New Members Round Table (NMRT), 2005 - 2015</h4>
        <ul class="sub_entries">
            <li>Archives Database Migration Task Force, 2013 - 2015
            <br />This is a special task force created to create an implementation plan to the NMRT Board for migrating the NMRT Archives database to ALA's institutional repository. Activities include metadata decisions and coordinating with the current database administrator and representatives of ALA's IR.
            </li>
            <li>Web Committee, 2011 - 2013
            <br />This committee keeps the NMRT website up to date. I received training on both the old Collage system and the new Drupal system. I made edits to pages as requested by NMRT committee chairs in my assigned area (Member Services, which included Footnotes, Mentoring, Resume Review, and Web).</li>
            <li>Archives Committee, 2008 - 2011

            <br />This committee oversees the NMRT Mentoring Program. I had a group of mentor/mentee pairs for which I was responsible.  I introduced them to each other, gave them a discussion topic once a month, and served as their point-person if problems came up during their time together.</li>

<h3>TLA</h3>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>I joined the Tennessee Library Association (TLA) in 2006 while I was working on my Masters degree at UTK.  It seemed only logical to join a statewide organization associated with my budding career choice.  During my time as a TLA member, I’ve come to realize that it is really important to network with your neighbors.  I really enjoy connecting and collaborating with fellow Tennessee librarians and exchanging ideas on how we can better our institutions.</p>

        <h4>Webmaster, 2017 - present; Assistant Webmaster, 2016 - 2017</h4>
        <p>Alongside the Assitant Webmaster, I am responsible primarily for content creation and updates on the TLA website. I also work with the Assistant Webmaster on minor technical manners, interfacing with the website vendor as needed for technical assistance.</p>

        <h4>Social Media Co-Manager, 2011 - present</h4>
        <p>I co-manage TLA's social media presence. I am primarily responsible for TLA&#8217;s Twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/tnla">@tnla</a>). I also help make decisions and form policies/procedures regarding TLA's use of social media.</p>

        <h4>Publications Advisory Board, 2011 - present</h4>
        <h4>TLA Board of Directors, 2011 - 2018</h4>
        <p>My positions as Webmaster and Social Media Co-Manager mean I am automatically a member of these groups as well. The Board of Directors was dissolved in 2018 as part of the TLA restructuring process.</p>

        <h4>Conference App Co-Manager, 2012 - present</h4>
        <p>In 2012, a grassroots effort amongst a small group of interested TLA members produced TLA's first app for annual conference. This informal group continues to operate outside of the official Conference Committee to produce an app that conference attendees find very useful. From 2012-2014, we used the free version of Guidebook to build the app. In 2015, we switched to Sched, having been granted funds to pay for their basic service. I am the main administrator of the app, coordinating amongst multiple stakeholders to get the information needed to populate the app with necessary conference information such as program schedules, exhibitors and booth locations, and local attractions.</p>

        <h4>Co-Chair, Library Technologies Roundtable, 2016</h4>
        <p>I was asked to take on this position mid-year with a colleague following the departure of the previous chair.</p>

        <h4>Membership Committee (Co-Chair, 2014-2015, 2012-2013; Member, 2009 - 2012, 2013-2014)</h4>
        <p>Membership has declined in recent years due to the economy. Thus, the work of this committee mainly focused on how we could recruit and retain members during these challenging times.</p>

        <h4>Recording Secretary, 2012 - 2013</h4>
        <p>I attended all quarterly board meetings, recorded action items and discussion, and made that information available to the membership. I was also a member of the Executive Committee, which is the final decision-making body for the association.</p>

        <h4>2012 Conference Committee, Registration Co-Chair, 2011 - 2012</h4>
        <p>This was my first conference committee experience. I thrive on detail-oriented tasks, so registration was an excellent fit for me. My co-chair and I oversaw the registration booth, put together attendee packets and badges, and maintained statistics on our registered attendees.</p>

<h3>Tenn-Share</h3>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>In 2008, a friend of mine and I were approached to redesign the Tenn-Share website. I have served as Co-Webmistress and Co-Chair of the Web Committee ever since.</p>

        <h4>Co-Webmistress and Co-Chair of the Web Committee, 2008 – present</h4>
        <p>From 2008 - 2015, the Tenn-Share site was hosted in a custom Drupal installation. This was a highly technical task/position that gave me a great opportunity to sharpen my Drupal and coding skills. Basic responsibilities included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>attend board meetings</li>
            <li>troubleshoot technical problems</li>
            <li>build new features into the site as they are requested</li>
            <li>keep Drupal installation up to date</li>
            <li>help update content as needed</li>
            <li>serve as Listserv administrator</li>
            <li>keep DNS registrations current</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tenn-Share moved to a hosted solution for membership management, Timberlake, in 2015. The website is also hosted out of this system. While my technical responsibilities have lightened with this migration, I still administer the Listservs and DNS entries, and I work with the Co-Webmistress on advanced technical issues and tech-related policies.</p>

        <h4>Learn and Discover Lesson Expert, 2009 and 2010</h4>
        <p>Learn and Discover is a summer learning program based on the 23 Things learning program. Each week featured a different topic and an “expert” on that topic to help craft the lesson and interact with participants in that week’s forum discussion.  I participated in several lessons in 2009 and 2010:</p>
