											<p>I have worked in the Vanderbilt Libraries since 2003.  I was an Archives Assistant in Special Collections and University Archives from 2003-2007 while I was in graduate school at UTK.  In 2007 I moved to Library Digital Services (then Library Information Technology Services) to work as a Systems Librarian.</p>

											<p>During my time at Vanderbilt, I&#8217;ve been privileged to work on a variety of projects and collaborate with a lot of great colleagues.</p>

											<h3>Brown Bag session presentations</h3>
											<p><strong>Electronic Communication Plan, January 28, 2011</strong><br />
This presentation, co-presented with a coworker, explained our new electronic communication plan, especially with regards to social media.  We demonstrated the tools we were using for this task in hopes of attendees being able to use these tools in their own work.</p>
											<p><strong>Mastering your iPod Touch: Apps and Tips, May 28, 2009<br />
</strong>This informal sharing session focused on the iPod Touch, which was new and exciting at that time. I distributed a tips/FAQ sheet, and we all shared our favorite apps which were compiled into a Google Doc.</p>
											<p><strong>Google Docs, December 3, 2008<br />
</strong>This session focused on how to use Google Docs, which was fairly new and underutilized at that time.  I had a few slides with basic facts but spent most of the time in a live demo of Google Docs&#8217; three main tools (Doc, Spreadsheet, Presentation).<strong> </strong></p>
