    <h3>ALA</h3>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>I joined the American Library Association (ALA) in 2005 while I was still in graduate school.  I didn’t become more involved in the association until 2008, when I volunteered for some committee work with NMRT.  I always struggled with ALA involvement because of my historic lack of resources to attend ALA conferences.  I was able to find some committee assignments that did not require conference attendance, which was perfect. I was very honored to have been chosen to participate in the ALA Emerging Leaders Program in 2012, sponsored by LITA. Since then, I have been able to be more involved in LITA and hope to continue this trend in the coming years.</p>

        <h4>Library Information Technology Association (LITA), 2007 - present</h4>
        <ul class="sub_entries">
            <li>Web Coordinating Committee, 2012 - present
            <br />Vice-Chair, 2014-2015; Member, 2012-2014
            <br />This committee keeps the LITA's various web presences up to date.</li>
            <li>Christian Larew Scholarship Committee, 2012 - 2013
            <br />This committee reviews applications for this scholarship and selects a worthy recipient.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>New Members Round Table (NMRT), 2005 - present</h4>
        <ul class="sub_entries">
            <li>Archives Database Migration Task Force, 2013 - present
            <br />This is a special task force created to create an implementation plan to the NMRT Board for migrating the NMRT Archives database to ALA's institutional repository. Activities include metadata decisions and coordinating with the current database administrator and representatives of ALA's IR.
            </li>
            <li>Web Committee, 2011 - 2013
            <br />This committee keeps the NMRT website up to date. I received training on both the old Collage system and the new Drupal system. I made edits to pages as requested by NMRT committee chairs in my assigned area (Member Services, which included Footnotes, Mentoring, Resume Review, and Web).</li>
            <li>Archives Committee, 2008 - 2011
            <br />The Archives Committee has the important task of getting all NMRT committee and board member reports into a database for future access and searchability. My background in archives work drew me to this committee.</li>
            <li>Mentoring Committee, 2008 - 2009
            <br />This committee oversees the NMRT Mentoring Program. I had a group of mentor/mentee pairs for which I was responsible.  I introduced them to each other, gave them a discussion topic once a month, and served as their point-person if problems came up during their time together.</li>

<h3>TLA</h3>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>I joined the Tennessee Library Association (TLA) in 2006 while I was working on my Masters degree at UTK.  It seemed only logical to join a statewide organization associated with my budding career choice.  During my time as a TLA member, I’ve come to realize that it is really important to network with your neighbors.  I really enjoy connecting and collaborating with fellow Tennessee librarians and exchanging ideas on how we can better our institutions.</p>

        <h4>Membership Committee (Co-Chair, 2014-2015, 2012-2013; Member, 2009 - 2012, 2013-2014)</h4>
        <p>Membership has declined in recent years due to the economy. Thus, the work of this committee has been focused on how we can recruit and retain members during this challenging time.</p>

        <h4>Social Media Co-Manager, 2011 - present</h4>
        <p>I co-manage TLA's social media presence along with Jeffie Nicholson. I am primarily responsible for TLA&#8217;s Twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/tnla">@tnla</a>) and also maintain TLA's Google+ account. I also help make decisions and form policies/procedures regarding TLA's use of social media.</p>

        <h4>Publications Advisory Board, 2011 - present</h4>
        <h4>TLA Board of Directors, 2011 - present</h4>
        <p>My position as Social Media Co-Manager means I am automatically a member of these groups as well.</p>

        <h4>Conference App Co-Manager, 2012 - present</h4>
        <p>In 2012, a grassroots effort amongst a small group of interested TLA members produced TLA's first app for annual conference. This informal group continues to operate outside of the official Conference Committee to produce an app that conference attendees find very useful. From 2012-2014, we used the free version of Guidebook to build the app. For 2015, we have switched to Sched, having been granted funds to pay for their basic service. I am the main administrator of the app, coordinating amongst multiple stakeholders to get the information needed to populate the app with necessary conference information such as program schedules, exhibitors and booth locations, and local attractions.</p>

        <h4>Recording Secretary, 2012 - 2013</h4>
        <p>I attended all quarterly board meetings, recorded action items and discussion, and made that information available to the membership. I was also a member of the Executive Committee, which is the final decision-making body for the association.</p>

        <h4>2012 Conference Committee, Registration Co-Chair, 2011 - 2012</h4>
        <p>This was my first conference committee experience. I thrive on detail-oriented tasks, so registration was an excellent fit for me. My co-chair and I oversaw the registration booth, put together attendee packets and badges, and maintained statistics on our registered attendees.</p>

<h3>Tenn-Share</h3>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>In 2008, a friend of mine and I were approached to redesign the Tenn-Share website. I have served as Co-Webmistress and Co-Chair of the Web Committee ever since.</p>

        <h4>Co-Webmistress and Co-Chair of the Web Committee, 2008 – present</h4>
        <p>Basic responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>attend board meetings</li>
            <li>troubleshoot technical problems</li>
            <li>build new features into the site as they are requested</li>
            <li>keep Drupal installation up to date</li>
            <li>help update content as needed</li>
            <li>serve as Listserv administrator</li>
            <li>keep DNS registrations current</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tenn-Share is currently in the process of migrating to a hosted solution for membership management, Timberlake. The website will also be hosted out of this solution. I am assisting with decisions throughout this project and with migrating content to the new system.</p>

        <h4>Learn and Discover Lesson Expert, 2009 and 2010</h4>
        <p>Learn and Discover is a summer learning program based on the 23 Things learning program. Each week featured a different topic and an “expert” on that topic to help craft the lesson and interact with participants in that week’s forum discussion.  I participated in several lessons in 2009 and 2010:</p>
