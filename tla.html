											<p>I joined the Tennessee Library Association (TLA) in 2006 while I was working on my Masters degree at UTK.  It seemed only logical to join a statewide organization associated with my budding career choice.  During my time as a TLA member, I've come to realize that it's really important to network with your neighbors.  I really enjoy connecting and collaborating with fellow Tennessee librarians and exchanging ideas on how we can better our institutions.</p>

											<h3>Service</h3>
											<p><strong>Recording Secretary, 2012 - 2013</strong>
											<br />I attend all quarterly board meetings, record action items and discussion, and make that information available to the membership. I am also a member of the Executive Committee, which is the final decision-making body for the association.</p>

											<p><strong>Social Media Co-Manager, 2011 - present</strong>
											<br />I co-manage TLA's social media presence along with Jeffie Nicholson. I am primarily responsible for TLA's Twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/tnla">@tnla</a>). I also help make decisions and form policies/procedures regarding TLA's use of social media.</p>
											
											<p><strong>Publications Advisory Board, 2011 - present</strong>
											<br /><strong>TLA Board of Directors, 2011 - present</strong>
											<br />My position as Social Media Co-Manager means I'm automatically a member of these groups as well.</p>
					
											<p><strong>Membership Committee (Co-Chair, 2012-2013; Member, 2009 - present)</strong>
											<br />Membership has been declining in recent years due to the economy. Thus, the work of this committee has been focused on how we can recruit and retain members during this rough time.</p>

											<p><strong>2012 Conference Committee, Registration Co-Chair, 2011 - 2012</strong>
											<br />This is my first conference committee experience, and something I've wanted to be a part of for a couple of years now. I was lucky to be given this opportunity for 2012. I thrive on detail-oriented tasks, so registration is a good fit for me. My co-chair and I will be overseeing the registration booth, putting together attendee packets and badges, and maintaining statistics on our registered attendees.</p>
