==================

This is my attempt at learning [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), while also building an online portfolio.

[This blog post at 24 Ways](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) was immensely helpful in teaching me how to set up Github Pages and Jekyll.
